 Location manager that allows to get a background location update every *n* seconds.
 
## Usage 
##### 1. Configure Xcode project

In target ````Capabilities```` enable ````Background Modes```` and check ````Location updates````

In ````Info.plist```` add ````NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription```` key and value that will specify the reason for your app to access the userâ€™s location information at all times.

##### 2. Create instance of `APScheduledLocationManager`

````swift
let manager = APScheduledLocationManager(delegate: self)
````
##### 3. Confirm to ````APScheduledLocationManagerDelegate```` 

````swift
func scheduledLocationManager(_ manager: APScheduledLocationManager, didFailWithError error: Error){

}

func scheduledLocationManager(_ manager: APScheduledLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {

}

func scheduledLocationManager(_ manager: APScheduledLocationManager, didChangeAuthorization status: CLAuthorizationStatus) {

}
````
##### 4. Request authorized always permission

You can use ````requestAlwaysAuthorization()```` helper method of ````APScheduledLocationManager```` or your own implementation. 



##### 4. Start location manager when permission is granted

````swift
manager.startUpdatingLocation(interval: 170, acceptableLocationAccuracy: 100)
````
There are 2 options to adjust the location manager: 

- ````interval: TimeInterval```` - interval with which the location will be gathered. The range is between 2 - 170 seconds, lower or higher values will be overwritten
- ````acceptableLocationAccuracy: CLLocationAccuracy```` - the location manager will wait till locations with desired accuracy are retrieved. 

## Example 

There is working example ````ScheduledLocationExample```` in the projet
